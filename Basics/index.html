        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
            type specimen
            book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
            essentially
            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
            passages, and more
            recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <p>Try adding the following declaration to your rule:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</li>
            <li>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much available space along the main axis each flex item
            will take up compared to other flex items. In this case, we're giving each
            element the same value (a value of 1), which means they'll all take up an equal amount of the spare space
            left after properties like padding and margin have been set.
